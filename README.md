# About
This is the project work for the course "Advanced Web Applications" at LUT University. The project is a fullstack web application for sharing code snippets. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Requirements
- Implementation of backend with Node.js
    - You can of course use Express, Meteor or any other additional framework
- Utilization of database
    - MongoDB
- Authentication frontend and backend
    - You can use JWT or session based authorization
    - Users have to have an option to register and login
    - Only authenticated users can post, comment (or vote)
- Features
    - Authenticated users can:
        - Post new code snippets
        - Comment on existing posts
    - Non-authenticated users can see posts, comments (and vote counts)
    - There is some page listing all the post, after opening one post, comments are also listed
- Responsive design
    - The app needs to be usable with mobile devices and desktop browsers
        - Use of Materialize or Bootstrap is recommended
- Documentation
    - There needs to be documentation describing the technology choices, installation guidelines and user manual
    - Also list the features you have implemented and the number of points you are aiming at
